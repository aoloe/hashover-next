# Notes about the use on impagina/project

On impagina/project, hashover is used as a mean for "anonymous" contributors for adding comments and new stuff for project descriptions.  
It should work in a similar way as the PHP documentation currently works.

Comments that have been copied over to the main content, will be set as closed / hidden.

Using markdown in the comments will make it easier to integrate the submissions.
